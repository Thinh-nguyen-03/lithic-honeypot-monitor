üé™ **Enhanced Scammer Interaction Scenarios (PRODUCTION READY)** ‚úÖ

## Scenario 1: Real-Time Transaction + Card Verification ‚úÖ
**Setup**: AI agent receives real-time transaction alert + has card access tools

```
[Transaction occurs: $1.00 at Shell Gas Station, Main St, Dallas, TX]
[AI agent uses get_card_details to get PAN: 4111111111111234]

Agent: "I see you just made a transaction. Can you tell me what you purchased?"
Scammer: "I bought coffee at Starbucks"
Agent: [Knows it was gas station] "Interesting. Can you verify your card information?"
Scammer: "Sure, what do you need?"
Agent: "Can you read me the full card number you just used?"
Scammer: "Umm, it's 4532... something"
Agent: [Knows it's 4111111111111234] "That doesn't match our records. The number should start with 4111..."
```

## Scenario 2: Card Number Verification Without Transaction ‚úÖ
**Setup**: AI agent uses card access tools proactively during suspicious call

```
[Scammer claims to need help with their card]
[AI agent uses list_available_cards to see options]
[AI agent selects specific card and uses get_card_details]

Agent: "I can help verify your account. What are the last 4 digits of your card?"
Scammer: "It ends in 9876"
Agent: [Knows from card data it should be 1234] "I'm showing a different number. Can you double-check?"
Scammer: "Oh, maybe it's 1234"
Agent: [Confirms match] "That's correct. Now, can you read me the full 16-digit number?"
Scammer: "4111 1111 1111 1234"
Agent: [Perfect match] "Thank you. Now I have some specific questions about your recent activity..."
```

## Scenario 3: Multi-Card Verification Testing ‚úÖ
**Setup**: AI agent tests scammer knowledge across multiple honeypot cards

```
[AI agent uses list_available_cards to see all options]
[Multiple cards available: ending in 1234, 5678, 9012]

Agent: "I see multiple cards on your account. Let's verify the one you're calling about."
Scammer: "The one ending in 5555"
Agent: [Knows no card ends in 5555] "I don't see that card. We have cards ending in 1234, 5678, and 9012."
Scammer: "Oh right, the 5678 one"
Agent: [Uses get_card_details for card ending in 5678] "Can you confirm the full number for that card?"
Scammer: [Likely can't provide correct number]
Agent: "I'm detecting some inconsistencies in your responses..."
```
